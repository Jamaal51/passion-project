Problem: Creating a dating profile is really hard. There's the pressure to be interesting, yet brief, funny, but subtle, and honest but not oversharing. With all that, do you even really know yourself and the best parts of you or how to make your flaws look charming (if possible). It's not fun so why not take it out of your hands.

Solution: (TBD name) you give your closest friends the power to create your dating profile. Who better to present the best (and may be even worst) parts of you than your buddies, girlfriends or even both?! Your profile is compiled from responses from a form sent to your friends. Profile includes general info, awesome anecdotes, short one-liners about who you are, even pictures from your friends. You give them content control, with your ability to edit.
